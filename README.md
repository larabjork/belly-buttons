# Visualizing Belly Button Biodiversity
Data bootcamp week 13 - JS visualizations


## Overview of Project
This exercise involved using JavaScript, D3, and Plotly to create a dashboard with three different charts based on user input (i.e., after the user selects a test subject ID, the page loads the associated data into the three charts and shows the test subject's demographic information).

The guided homework portion of the exercise involved building a webpage using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, D3, and JavaScript. At this point, the only information displayed when a user ID was selected was the demographic informaiton of the test subject.

The independent challenge portion of the exercise involved the addition of three charts to the dashboard: a bar chart, a gauge chart, and a bubble chart. The challenge also required further customization of the page's styling.

## Results
### Changes to Styling
After adding the three required charts, the page looked like this:
![page prior to customization](https://github.com/larabjork/belly-buttons/blob/main/static/images/deliverables_1_to_3.png)

From the assignment's options to customize the page, I opted to do the following:
 * Add an image to the jumbotron (obtained from [pexels website](https://www.pexels.com/photo/close-up-photograph-of-petri-dishes-with-different-colors-4031366/). Photo credit: Edward Jenner.
 * Add a background color or a variety of compatible colors to the webpage
 * Use a custom font
 * Add more information about the project as a paragraph on the page.

## Summary
To further refine this page, I would complete the other options for page customization presented in the assignment:
* Add information about what each graph visualizes
* Make the webpage mobile-responsive
* Change the layout of the page
* Add a navigation bar that allows the user to select either the bar chart or bubble chart for display

I would also further refine the color palette, adjust the scaling of the jumbotron image,  standardize the font size across all three chart titles, conduct an accessibility assessment/test and modify accordingly.
